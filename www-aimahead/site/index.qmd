The CHoRUS AimAhead Portal currently offers a small collection of tools and services, all of which can be
accessed using through a jump-host-like Firefox browser allocated to each user.

- Open a **[User-Specific Environment](/lab/)** to access the ML workspace provisioned for the AimAhead Project
  - Note that other tools like ARES and ATLAS can be reached using bookmarks in this environment.
